# Name Sorter

A .NET application that sorts names from a file by Last Name and then by Given Names.

## Overview

Name Sorter is a command-line application that reads a list of names from a file, sorts them according to specific rules, and outputs the sorted results both to the console and to a file.

## Features

- Reads names from an input file
- Supports names with 1 to 3 given names and a single last name
- Sorts names by last name, then by given names
- Outputs sorted names to both console and file
- Flexible pipeline architecture for easy extension
- Command-line interface with customizable file input and output location

## Requirements

- .NET 9.0
- Windows/Linux/macOS compatible

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt
```

With custom output file:
```bash
name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt --output ./custom-output.txt
```

### Input File Format

- One name per line
- Each name can have between 1 and 3 given names followed by a single last name
- Names must be separated by single spaces

Example input file:

```txt
John Coltrane 
Peter Brotzmann
Tim Jones 
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
```

### Output

The application will:
1. Read names from the input file
2. Sort them according to the rules
3. Display the sorted names on the console
4. Write the sorted names to 'sorted-names-list.txt' (or to another output file specified in the command-line)

## Architecture

The application uses a pipeline-based architecture with the following key components:

### Core Components

- **Pipeline Pattern**: Modular processing steps for extensibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Command Line Interface**: Using System.CommandLine
- **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible output handling

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Read**: Extracts names from input file
2. **Sort**: Orders names by last name and given names
3. **Output**: Writes results to console and file

### Key Interfaces

- `IPipelineStep`: Base interface for all pipeline steps
- `IOutputStrategy`: Defines output behavior
- `INameParser`: Handles name parsing logic
- `INameSorter`: Manages name sorting functionality

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid input files
- Malformed names
- Invalid command-line arguments
- File system issues

However as requirements develop we may prefer to provide more meaningful feedback to end-users about issues, especially with the content of the supplied input file
